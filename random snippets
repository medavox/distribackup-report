Distribackup is a cloud-based solution for backup of irreplaceable data, such as family photos and videos. It places the user in control of their data (as opposed to hosting the file with a company that has a binding contract which may waive original ownership), by having 
them provide the infrastructure of distributed storage. Distribackup handles syncing the geographically distant copies.

Like it or not, much important information is now shared exclusively through transient social media such as Reddit. No one else but the OP performed this test. We must engage with original reserch, wherever it occurs.
